# GitHub Setup Guide

This guide outlines the process of setting up and maintaining the JobTracker CRM project on GitHub.

## Initial Repository Setup

1. **Create a GitHub repository**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
   - Log in to your account
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
   - Enter "jobtracker-crm" as the repository name
   - Add a description (e.g., "A CRM system for job seekers")
   - Choose visibility (public or private)
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Connect local repository to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   # Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jobtracker-crm.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Working with the Repository

### Branching Strategy

For feature development and bug fixes, follow this workflow:

1. **Create a branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive message about your changes"
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/new-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub
   - Click "Compare & pull request"
   - Add a description of your changes
   - Request a review if working with a team
   - Click "Create pull request"

### Common Git Commands

```bash
# Check status of working directory
git status

# Pull latest changes from remote
git pull

# View commit history
git log

# Discard local changes to a file
git checkout -- filename

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b branch-name

# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout branch-name

# Merge changes from another branch
git merge branch-name
```

## Best Practices

1. **Commit Messages**:
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Start with a verb in imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
   - Keep the first line under 50 characters
   - Add more details in subsequent lines if needed

2. **Pull Requests**:
   - Keep PRs focused on a single feature or bug fix
   - Include a clear description of what changed and why
   - Reference any relevant issues using #issue-number
   - Add screenshots for UI changes when applicable

3. **Code Reviews**:
   - Review all code before merging to main
   - Look for logic errors, security issues, and code quality
   - Ensure code follows project conventions
   - Test changes locally before approving

4. **Branch Management**:
   - Delete branches after merging
   - Keep the main branch stable and deployable
   - Use feature branches for all changes

## Security Considerations

1. **Sensitive Information**:
   - Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.)
   - Use environment variables and .env files (excluded via .gitignore)
   - If sensitive data is accidentally committed, change the credentials immediately

2. **Access Control**:
   - Review repository permissions regularly
   - Use branch protection rules for the main branch
   - Require pull request reviews before merging

## GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

For future implementation:

1. **Automated Testing**:
   - Set up workflows to run tests on pull requests
   - Require passing tests before merging

2. **Deployment Automation**:
   - Configure workflows to deploy to staging/production
   - Implement environment-specific checks
